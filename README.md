# TypeScript Microservice Example

This is an example of a nodejs microservice built using TypeScript and a number of libraries to achieve decoupled architecture with proper DI(dependency injection) and IOC(inversion of control).

The intent is to eventually use this architecture pattern, along with the starter project concept that this example was built from, and create a TypeScript based framework for building node microservices quickly and efficiently.

The goal would be to have a CLI that along with schematics would generate the boilerplate in a standardized format. Angular and it's CLI are a strong inspiration for this project.
